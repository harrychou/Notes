Test Driven JavaScript Note

Ch01 Epi01

	Professional Javascript Development Practice
	- support all browser
	- team developed' and maintained'
	- easy to maintain

	Channels
	- Live channel (creating the app)
	- Lessions learned

	GitHub, encourage to fork and participation

	App: weewikipaint

	Git setup
	* git init
	* create README
	* git add
	* git commit

	WebStorm
	* create 
	* create .gitingore file to ignore workspace.xml file

	Agile Practice
	* MMF (Minimum Marketable Feature)
	* User Stories
	* Engineering Tasks

	Jake
	* Javascript Make
	* tasks
	* dependency ...

Ch01 E02

	Build script/automation

	Static Code Analysis
	* Lint
	* Especially important to JavaScript dev

	Jake -> Default task

	Automate Linting
	* LintRunner
		- use JSHint underneath, can switch to others
	* Lesson Learned episode linked
	
	Use Jake to run lint as defalt task
	* reqire the lint_runner.js
	* run the validateFile()
	* npm install jshint
		- npm puts all files under node_module, which is very easy to share
	* include all js files
	* exclude node modules
	* setup options for JSHint

Ch01 E03

	Configure JSHint options
	* make it strict first, loose it later

	JS Hoisting causing JSHint to fail
	* end up need to make the whole thing in a immediate function

	Continuous Integration
	* Make sure we have a known good build
	* set up the integration branch

Ch01 E04
	
	Continuous Integration Setup
	* having everybody's work integrated
	* make sure the build is always working well
		- if something doesn't work -> it's your fault, cause you alway integrate with known good build

	Setting up Build Server
	* use a Windows Machine on Mac VMWare
	* Share folder as a way to share repository
	* git clone from Mac's repository
	* to build on windows 
		- install git
		- clone repository
		- install node
		- create bat file

	For creating an integration branch
	* just git checkout integration

Ch01 E05

	Cheat integration
	* create a jake task call Integrate, and integrate will depend on default task
	* use manual instructions
		- Make sure git status is clean
		- Build on the integration box
			* walk over to integration box
			* git pull
			* jake
			* if jake fails, stop! try again
		- git check out integration
		- git merge master --no-ff --log
		- git checkout master

	Always make sure you have a good build

	Make build fail when lint failed

	desc("Lint everything");
	task("lint", ["nodeVersion"], function() {
		var lint = require("./build/lint/lint_runner.js");

		var javascriptFiles = new jake.FileList();
		javascriptFiles.include("**/*.js");
		javascriptFiles.exclude("node_modules");
		var options = nodeLintOptions();
		var passed = lint.validateFileList(javascriptFiles.toArray(), options, {});
		if (!passed) fail("Lint failed");
	});

	use gitk to make sure we are doing continuous integration correctly
