Ch01 E02

	Build script/automation

	Static Code Analysis
	* Lint
	* Especially important to JavaScript dev

	Jake -> Default task

	Automate Linting
	* LintRunner
		- use JSHint underneath, can switch to others
	* Lesson Learned episode linked
	
	Use Jake to run lint as defalt task
	* reqire the lint_runner.js
	* run the validateFile()
	* npm install jshint
		- npm puts all files under node_module, which is very easy to share
	* include all js files
	* exclude node modules
	* setup options for JSHint

Ch01 E03

	Configure JSHint options
	* make it strict first, loose it later

	JS Hoisting causing JSHint to fail
	* end up need to make the whole thing in a immediate function

	Continuous Integration
	* Make sure we have a known good build
	* set up the integration branch

Ch01 E04
	
	Continuous Integration Setup
	* having everybody's work integrated
	* make sure the build is always working well
		- if something doesn't work -> it's your fault, cause you alway integrate with known good build
