1. Getting Started

1.1 About Version Control

	A VCS allows you to: 
	* revert files back to a previous state, 
	* revert the entire project back to a previous state, 
	* review changes made over time, 
	* see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, 
	* who introduced an issue and when, 
	* and more. 

	Types of VCS (version control system)
	* Local http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0101-tn.png
		- RCS
	* Central http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0102-tn.png
		- CVS/Subversion/Perforce
		- Single Server contains all versions
		- Adv
			* collaboration
			* easy to admin
		- Disadv
			* single point of failure 
	* Distributed http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0103-tn.png
		- Git/Mercurial/Bazar/Darcs
		- Each client have full mirror of the respository
		- Each client or server can be used to restore/copy to each other
		- Enable more flexible workflow within project

1.2 A Short History of Git

	From Linux project
	* from 1991 to 2002 - just patches and archive files
	* from 2002 - use proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper
	* 2005 - BitKeeper company stop provide it free of charge
		- Linus Torvalds started developing their own tool
	* goals
		- speed
		- simple design
		- strong support for non-linear development
		  (thousand of parallel branches)
		- fully distributed
		- able to handle big project (Linux Kernel, speed and data size)

1.3 Git Basics

	Git Basic
	* Important to learn basics of how Git works
	* Git's way of thinking/handling info are very different - source of confusion

	What's different of Git from others
	* Other think in terms of files and changes to the files
		- http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0104-tn.png
	* Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem
		http://git-scm.com/figures/18333fig0105-tn.png
		- every commit is like taking a snashop
		- if one file has no change, just store pointer to previous file instead save the new file
		- Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it
		- the benefits will be covered when discussing Git branching
