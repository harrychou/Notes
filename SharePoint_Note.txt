Ch1 Before Begin
  to get the verison number of Powershell (if variable does not exist, assume v1)
    $psversiontable.psversion 

Ch2 Command
  
  some bash commands are available
    * but not all options are accepted (ex. Dir /s)
    * these commands are still implemented by PowerShell commandlet

  file system commands
    Dir/ls
    Copy/cp
    Cd
    Ren (rename file)
    Mkdir 
    RmDir
    Del/rm
    Type/cat (display content of a file)

  take away: some commands still work, but may behave differently than cmd.exe or bash

  PSDrives
    * have a unified way to view hierachical data store
      - file system
      - registry (hkcu: hklm:)
    * to show all PSDrives mapped
      Get-PSDrive
      (can be long drive name)
    * to map your own PSDrive
      New-PSDrive -name DEMO -psprovider FileSystem -root \\Server\Share\Folder
      (unfortunately, this is not available to Windows Explorer)

  How to execute external commands with a lot of parameters:
    
    $exe = "C:\Vmware\vcbMounter.exe"
    $host = "server"
    $user = "joe"
    $password = "password"
    $machine = "somepc"
    $location = "somelocation"
    $backupType = "incremental"

    & $exe -h $host -u $user -p $password -s "name:$machine" -r $location -t $backupType

    (& is the way to turn string to command and call on it)

  Powershell command map to external command

    Get-ChildItem (for Dir, Ls)
    Set-Location (for Cd)
    Move-Item (for Move)
    Rename-Item (for Ren)
    Remove-Item (for Del, Rm, RmDir)
    Copy-Item (for Copy, Cp)
    Get-Content (for Type, Cat)
    New-Item (for MkDir)

  Powershell has consistent naming for commands
    
    Display a list of services Get-Service
    Display a list of running processes Get-Process
    Display the contents of an event log Get-EventLog
    Create a new service New-Service
    Retrieve Exchange mailboxes Get-Mailbox
    Create a new Exchange mailbox New-Mailbox
